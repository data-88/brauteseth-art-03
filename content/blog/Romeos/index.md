Anti-Influencer. DJ with 20% hit rate. Indian kitch. It’s the internet. Everything is a symbolic eating of brands and experiences. Labour documented as leisure. Influencer material everywhere but only tourists take photos. The snacks come around look like cocaine trays. I try blend in. Fucking Superman Nick raising his arms on the dance floor with some girl with a small face. That’s how it works I guess. People want to hook up. Sick but true.
