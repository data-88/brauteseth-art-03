Needed to get out of the rut in Cape Town. Can’t just hang out at Clarkes. I moved to Johannesburg where I worked for a cyber security consultancy who’s main font was Calibri. I thinkn that the cyber realm will be the future. So I'm busy building a cyber security empire but also doing my photos at the same time. Working on ways to see how I can leverage both realms. I used to judge Joburg harshly. Now it's home and it a place fulled with a lot of energy and opportunity.
