Needed to get out of the rut in Cape Town. Can’t just hang out at Clarkes. I moved to Johannesburg where I worked for a cyber security company who’s main font was Calibri. I thought that the cyber realm would be the future. But I'm now back to my photos, my writing and a life in Linden. I want to write again and share my expriences. A throwback to that original 16 year old who had to dream up a career and wanted to write. It's good to have a variety of lived experience for the purpose of content. I used to judge Joburg harshly. Now it's home. I'm back to writing so I can share my photos and ideas. I'm also doing a maths degree and taking   photos of shampoo cointainers in bathrooms.
