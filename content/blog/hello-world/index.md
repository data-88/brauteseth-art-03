Joburg how can I explain thee. I drove from the cradle of mankind into town on Bayers Naude. Then driving in the different direction to the middle-aged cyclists. An off duty police officer asked if I was doing Cocaine on restricted property. He called it something in Nigerian. 
Rust. Trucks for sale. A brand new BP garage with pick’n’pay fresh chicken wraps. There were a hundred little interesting things. I was at the art gallery called Nitrox and I’m heading home from the sculptured golf course of artifacts. Pure class. Corners of intellectual luxury.  I want to say Babylonstoren of Joburg. Contrived and international. They had a map with high density paper. Objects that could be found in the veld. But Amonio Bravonitch the polish staring eyes woman and some other famous names if I read more art blogsJerusalem in capital letters in stone formation seems like an entrance to a country estate. The Zuid Afrikaanze Republiek in Dainfurn colour palette.
