People treat you different when you drive a Hilux. A mixture of status and awe. The mean 2.8 Global Diesel has 130kw torque. Power coming out your eyeballs. I dominate what is Joburg North Western suburbs. I’m the king of the road. Joburg streets are always half open. Still operating on the victim. A perpetual construction site and a bakkie to rule the site. The security gates just open because it’s expensive looking.
