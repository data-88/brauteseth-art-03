Some pretty girls. In unique ways. Not the models you would see in Cape Town. A lot of makeup. All the resources and effort it took to get there. The logistics. The kids fighting in the car. The time shopping at Cresta mall. Anyway, it’s a public performance of ourselves. I went in all black like the drama department and got scorched like it was the surface of the sun. Exposed myself to so many awkward interactions with people. Lots of chipped dogs that get lost and appear on the WhatsApp group. There’s a cushion with LOVE on it. There’s shrubs (a trendy new drink( sold by a recently returned American in a caravan. There’s Volvo paid sponsorship in the car parking. Recycling. No cigarettes.
