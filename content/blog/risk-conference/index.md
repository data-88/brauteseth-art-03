The auditor general dug up some horribly racist stories from the rural areas. Then wrapped it in a story about love. The whole thing sounded very christian. Mostly black audience. Risk and compliance. But the Afrikaans professor from Sasol was getting all his slides copied onto smartphones. Gesus some of those Powerpoint. They were terrible.

There were a lot of risks. And Powerpoint with diagrams appearing in steps. Everything you can fit on a slide.
